Design Decisions and Scope

This project is about a smart mirror, which is clean and efficient to use. While this project can be useful for a variety of users, the features listed above will make the device particularly useful to students in dorms and who travel in vanity vans the size allows for it to be used on many surfaces like a wall or a table and its Wi-Fi connectivity means it can be utilized in a variety of places. The digital mirror basically gives an update on the weather and time. This project can be further scaled to add digital voice assistants and provide additional information based on personalized requests such as news, digital orders, health scales, etc. Currently, we want to work on providing weather updates in real time. We want to explore this project more in the upcoming future.
